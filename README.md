# Pac-Man Game

A browser-based recreation of the classic arcade hit, **Pac-Man**. 
This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for game logic, including grid-based movement, collision detection, and simple AI behavior for ghosts.

Learned to create a 2d pac-man game on JS 
with the help of a great tutorial by Chris Courses on YouTube
